# DESIGM Clustering Algorithm
**Density-sensitive Evolution-based Self-stabilization of Independent Gaussian Mixtures (DESIGM) Clustering**

## Overview

The DESIGM Clustering Algorithm is a novel algorithm that seeks to identify ideal clusters in data that allows for predictive classifications. It is based on generative Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) along with OPTICS to produce an algorithm that fits a variable number of Gaussian components to the given data and then groups these components into clusters in a density sensitive manner. This allows the DESIGM algorithm to overcome the limitations of GMMs and OPTICS. Namely, DESIGM, using an evolutionary approach, self-stabilizes the number of Gaussian components. By the use of Gaussian components, DESIGM provides capacity for predictive classifications in a sensible manner as opposed to OPTICS.
